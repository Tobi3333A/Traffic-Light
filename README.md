# Traffic Light
This is a traffic light system. The project was done to practice my JavaScript (DOM) skills.
## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
## How It Works
There are three buttons (not actual): Stop, Slow, and Go. When Stop is clicked, a red light shows in first circle (the background color of that circle changes); when Slow is clicked, a yellow light shows (the background color of that circle changes), but the red light goes off; when Go is clicked, a green light shows (the background color of that circle changes), but the yellow light goes off.<br>
In short, When Stop is clicked, the traffic light shows red; when Slow is clicked, the traffic light shows yellow; when Go is clicked, the trafc light shows green.
